I created a "Merry Christmas Day" animation to spread holiday cheer. This project features twinkling lights, falling snowflakes, and a beautifully decorated tree. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the animation comes to life with smooth transitions. I hope this project adds a bit of magic to your Christmas celebrations
